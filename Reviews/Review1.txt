Review for Andrew Hynes



Good: 
Great explanation of the grammar and the compiler is very easy to use

A lot of clear  testCases written. 

Good handling of errors





To improve: 
The interpreted accepts just 1 expression at a time. 
The mainParser.ml should be modified so that the interpreted can accept as many expressions as possible

Adding the feature of accepting round brackets in arithmetic expressions


in the future the compiler should recognize the built in OCaml functions ( like if .... the ... else ; for() ; while () )
